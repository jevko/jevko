# Jevko: minimal syntax 

[jevko.github.io](https://jevko.github.io) | [jevko.org](https://jevko.org)

**Jevko** is a minimal general-purpose syntax.

It can be used as a basic building block for simple and portable formats, languages, and notations in a variety of domains, such as data interchange, configuration, or text markup.

Below are a few illustrative examples of how Jevko formats compare to known formats in various domains.

 <!-- in terms of compactness, simplicity, and human-readability. -->
